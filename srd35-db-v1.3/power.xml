      <p>Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive as if you were a creature native to that environment. You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks, if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take no damage simply from being in that environment. You need not specify what environment you are adapting to when you manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout the duration.</p>
      <p>You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid, lava, fire, and electricity. Any environmental feature that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per round deals you only half the usual amount of damage.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You lead a caravan into the Astral Plane, leaving the Material Plane behind. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you wish, but only if you know your way (see below).</p>
      <p>You can bring other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects have each manifested <i>astral traveler</i> and are linked hand to hand with you at the time of the <i>astral caravan</i>'s manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous place, those who lead <i>astral caravans</i> usually choose to manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the Material Plane.</p>
      <p>The <i>astral caravan</i> power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain your original formation, until (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power while still traversing the Astral Plane, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain connecting the travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel psionics</i>. When the power ends, you and your fellow travelers halt in whatever portion of the Astral Plane you happen to be traversing (the Astral Plane is in many ways subjective in location; in any event, one place on the Astral looks much like any other).</p>
      <p>While you are traveling through the Astral Plane, those natives who happen to glimpse you and your fellow travelers perceive you to be moving at a speed of 30 feet (you can't run), with you flying in the lead and your fellow travelers strung out behind you, each linked to the next by one hand.</p>
      <p>Depending on your knowledge of the planes, your journey through the subjective space that is the Astral Plane may take a longer or shorter period of time. For each 24 hours you travel, make a Knowledge (the planes) check. Unless a location is particularly hard to find and well guarded, or conversely easy to find and well advertised, the average DC for an <i>astral caravan</i> journey should be set at 20. You cannot take 20 on this check, though you can take 10. Each check may be modified by your degree of familiarity with the destination or by some connection you have with the place; see the tables below.</p>
      <p/>

      <p>Each successful check indicates that you are one step closer to your goal. To finally arrive at your location, you must succeed on six checks within a span of 12 days. (If you fail to make six successful checks within the first 12 days, you can continue to make one check per day until you get the requisite six successes within a span of 12 consecutive days). When you successfully make the requisite number of checks, the journey ends, and you appear on your chosen plane within 10-1,000 (1d% x 10) miles of your intended destination on that plane.</p>

You remain visible within the translucent, amorphous enclosure. You can pick up or drop willing passengers, easily reaching through the film. Anything you hold is enveloped by the film. Any attacks made through the enclosure in either direction have a 25% miss chance due to the rippling membrane.</p><p>When you manifest this power in its augmented form, your apparent speed to those observing on the Astral Plane is 40 feet, and you can make a Knowledge (the planes) check once every 12 hours to attempt to make it to your destination (six successful checks within 12 consecutive days still sees you to your desired goal).</p><p/>

Since the Astral Plane touches upon other planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you wish, but only if you know your way (see below).</p><p>You can bring other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects have each manifested <i>astral traveler</i> and are linked hand to hand with you at the time of the <i>astral caravan</i>'s manifestation. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey that causes you to break hand-to-hand contact, your companions are stranded wherever you leave them. Because the planes are a dangerous place, those who lead <i>astral caravans</i> usually choose to manifest this power only if they have a large party of travelers assembled. Sometimes groups of lower-level adventurers may hire you to lead forays beyond the Material Plane.</p><p>The <i>astral caravan</i> power lasts while you and your fellow travelers maintain your original formation, until (1) you reach your intended destination plane, (2) you desire to end the power while still traversing the Astral Plane, (3) you or anyone traveling with you breaks the hand-to-hand chain connecting the travelers for 2 consecutive rounds, or (4) the power is terminated by some outside means, such as <i>dispel psionics</i>. When the power ends, you and your fellow travelers halt in whatever portion of the Astral Plane you happen to be traversing (the Astral Plane is in many ways subjective in location; in any event, one place on the Astral looks much like any other).</p><p>While you are traveling through the Astral Plane, those natives who happen to glimpse you and your fellow travelers perceive you to be moving at a speed of 30 feet (you can't run), with you flying in the lead and your fellow travelers strung out behind you, each linked to the next by one hand.</p><p>Depending on your knowledge of the planes, your journey through the subjective space that is the Astral Plane may take a longer or shorter period of time. For each 24 hours you travel, make a Knowledge (the planes) check. Unless a location is particularly hard to find and well guarded, or conversely easy to find and well advertised, the average DC for an <i>astral caravan</i> journey should be set at 20. You cannot take 20 on this check, though you can take 10.

You can have only one <i>astral seed</i> in existence at any one time. Until such time as you perish, the <i>astral seed</i> (also called the storage crystal) is utterly inert.

You have thirty days to grow an organic body, after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it hasn't entered a new body.</p>
      <p>To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in uninterrupted solitude. The body's constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested <i>astral seed</i> (the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic body).

You possess all the abilities you possessed when <i>astral seed</i> was manifested, at one level lower, but you have none of your equipment.</p>
      <p>If the body is struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day period when it is growing, it is destroyed and your soul passes on.</p>

      <p><i>Disguise:</i> If you use this power to disguise the subject's alignment and level, the power has a duration of 10 minutes per level. You can change the subject's alignment by only one step. You can adjust the subject's apparent level up or down by a number equal to one-half your own level (rounded down) or less.</p>
      <p><i>Remove Compulsion:</i> If you use this power to attempt to cleanse the subject's aura of a baleful or controlling effect, the duration is instantaneous. This power can remove the compulsion of a curse or a <i>geas/quest</i> effect. It can also negate any charm and compulsion powers of 6th level or lower, such as <i>crisis of breath</i> or <i>death urge</i>. When <i>aura alteration</i> is manifested for this purpose, the subject gains another saving throw to remove the compulsion afflicting it against the original save DC, but with a +2 bonus.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Your posture becomes stooped forward, and you grow a muzzle complete with fangs. You gain one bite attack each round, instead of or in addition to any other attacks you have, that deals 1d8 points of damage (assuming you are a Medium creature) when it hits.</p>
      <p>Your bite attack is a natural weapon, so you are considered armed when attacking with it, and it can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural weapons. You can choose to deal nonlethal damage with your bite, taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll. If you bite as your only attack, you use your highest base attack bonus on the attack roll, and you can apply your full Strength bonus to damage. If you bite in addition to making other attacks, the bite is a secondary attack.</p>
      <p>If you are not a Medium creature, your bite attack's base damage varies as follows: Fine 1d2, Diminutive 1d3, Tiny 1d4, Small 1d6, Large 2d6, Huge 2d8, Gargantuan 4d6, Colossal 6d6.</p>
      <p>Based on your psychic warrior level, your bite increases in ferocity as noted here: at 5th level your bite deals an extra 1d8 points of damage, at 10th level an extra 2d8, at 15th level an extra 3d8, and at 20th level an extra 4d8 points.</p>

      <p>By manifesting this power, you generate psychic static, interfering with the ability of other psionic characters to manifest their powers or use psi-like abilities (you are not affected by your own <i>catapsi</i> manifestation). All psionic activity within the area requires 4 more power points to manifest than normal, unless a character makes a Will save each time he attempts to manifest a power.

      <p>The limit on the number of power points a subject can spend on a power remains in effect; thus, a subject may not be able to manifest its highest-level powers.

      <p>If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to energize that weapon.

      <p>You call forth the aggressive nature of the beast inherent in yourself, psionically transforming your hands into deadly claws. You gain two natural attacks with your claws, each dealing 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if you are Large, or 1d3 if you are Small) plus your Strength bonus.</p>
      <p>Your claws are natural weapons, so you are considered armed when attacking with them, and they can be affected by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve natural. You can choose to deal nonlethal damage with your claws, taking the standard -4 penalty on your attack roll.</p>
      <p>Your claws work just like the natural weapons of many monsters. You can make an attack with one claw or a full attack with two claws at your normal attack bonus, replacing your normal attack routine. You take no penalties for two-weapon fighting, and neither attack is a secondary attack. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks-you simply have two claw attacks at your normal attack bonus.</p>
      <p>You can manifest this power with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power on your turn before you attack. Manifesting this power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn't your turn.</p>
      <p>You can call or dismiss the claws as a swift action during the duration of the power.

      <p>If you have a claw attack (either from an actual natural weapon or from an effect such as <i>claws of the beast</i>), you can use this power to change the nature of that weapon. When this power is manifested, your claws take on an ominous glimmer. Each time you make a successful claw attack against a living creature of Small or larger size, you are healed of some amount of damage.</p>
      <p>You heal a number of hit points equal to half the base damage dealt by your <i>claws of the vampire</i>,  rounded down (additional damage dealt because of a high Strength score or other enhancements does not count toward the amount you heal). You heal as many hit points as can be gained while the creature remains at 1 hit point or higher. Any damage that would reduce the creature to 0 or fewer hit points does not benefit you.</p>
      <p>You do not heal damage if your attack deals nonlethal damage, such as when you attack a creature that has the regeneration ability. Moreover, you gain no healing from attacking any creature that is under the effect of <i>biofeedback</i>. Using <i>fission</i> on yourself and then attacking your duplicate also fails to grant any healing.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You pyrokinetically control the intensity or movements of one fire source. A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the nature of your control, while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning, animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of <i>control flames</i>,  then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.</p>
      <p>This power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.</p>
      <p>An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the fire does + your Int modifier if you are a psion or your Cha modifier if you are a wilder). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire's space); see the accompanying table).</p>
      <p>At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify f lames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Ref lex saves after the first).</p>

A nonmagical fire source can be controlled if it is equal to or smaller than the maximum size of fire you can control according to your manifester level, as noted on the accompanying table. You can freely switch control between fire sources, or change the nature of your control, while you maintain concentration, but only one specified change (keeping a fire burning, animating it, or altering its size) can be made to one fire source in a round. When your control over a fire source lapses, that fire immediately returns to its original state (or goes out if it has no fuel or has been moved away from its original location). With this power, you can artificially keep a fire burning that would normally expire for lack of fuel; even dousing a controlled flame with water does not put it out (though completely submerging the flame would). Normally, a creature at risk of catching on fire can avoid this fate by making a DC 15 Reflex saving throw, with success indicating that the fire has gone out. If the fire is one that has been kept burning by the use of <i>control flames</i>,  then the DC of the Reflex save needed to put out the flames increases to 25.</p><p>This power also enables you to make a fire move as if it were a living creature. You can animate only a naturally burning fire; if you attempt to animate one that has been increased or decreased in size by your augmentation of this power, the fire immediately returns to its original size. An animated fire moves at a speed of 30 feet. A fire that moves away from its fuel or its original location dies as soon as your control over it lapses.</p><p>An animated fire can enter any square, even if a creature already occupies it. If an animated fire enters a square occupied by a creature, that creature can make a Reflex save to get out of the way (DC 11 + the number of dice of damage the fire does + your Int modifier if you are a psion or your Cha modifier if you are a wilder). A successful Reflex save moves the creature to the nearest unoccupied square. The flames deal the indicated damage to any creature that is either on fire or surrounded by the flames (in the fire's space); see the accompanying table).</p><p>At the start of your turn, the animated fire deals damage to any creature in its space, and the creature catches on fire unless it makes a Reflex save (DC as noted above). A victim on fire takes 1d6 points of damage each round. Additional rounds in the same space as the animated fire occupies mean additional chances of ignition. The damage from multiple normal fires stacks, but the victim gets a saving throw each round to negate each fire. It is possible to switch control from the animated fire (causing it to disappear) to intensify f lames that are already burning (thus denying the foe Ref lex saves after the first).</p><p/><table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" frame="VOID" rules="ROWS">

The subject recognizes you, and you can mentally communicate with it for the duration (though nothing forces the subject to respond to you), exchanging messages of twenty-five words or less once per round. Receiving a message is not an action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity; however, sending a message is equivalent to a standard action that can provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound the power creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per manifester level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.

    <description>
      <p>You detect psionic auras. A psionic aura is given off by any active or permanent power, or during the use of any psionic feat. Characters who have levels in a psionic class, creatures with the psionic subtype, and creatures with the Wild Talent feat possess psionic auras. The amount of information revealed by the manifestation of this power depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.</p>
      <p><i>1st Round:</i> Presence or absence of psionic auras.</p>
      <p><i>2nd Round:</i> Number of different psionic auras and the strength of the most potent aura.</p>
      <p><i>3rd Round:</i> The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Psicraft checks to determine the discipline involved in each aura. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + power level, or 15 + one-half manifester level for an effect that is not created by a power, such as that of a psionic item.)</p>
      <p>Psionically charged locations, multiple disciplines, or strong local psionic emanations may confuse or conceal weaker auras.</p>
      <p/>
      <p><i>Aura Strength:</i> A psionic aura's strength depends on a functioning power's level or an item's manifester level. If an aura falls into more than one category, <i>detect psionics</i> indicates the stronger of the two. Detection of an overwhelming aura (see the accompanying table) dazes you for 1 round and the power ends.</p>

    <short_description>Cancels psionic powers and effects.</short_description>
    <description>
      <p>You can use <i>Dispel psionics</i> to end ongoing powers that have been manifested on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to end ongoing powers (or at least their effects) within an area. A dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel psionics</i>,  or can be ended only if you manifest <i>Dispel psionics</i> at a high enough manifester level. <i>Dispel psionics</i> can end spell-like effects just as it does powers.</p>
      <p>The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the <i>Dispel psionics</i> can take effect.</p>
      <p>You choose to use <i>Dispel psionics</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.</p>
      <p><i>Targeted Dispel:</i> One object, creature, or power is the target of the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum +10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the power's manifester level. If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.</p>
      <p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item's manifester level. If you succeed, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface  is temporarily closed. A psionic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this.</p>
      <p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.</p>
      <p><i>Area Dispel:</i> When <i>Dispel psionics</i> is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's psionic items are not affected.</p>
      <p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p>
      <p>For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.</p>
      <p>For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p>
      <p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the creature or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.</p>

    <augment><p><b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).</p><p/>

If you succeed on a particular check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power or is under the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item's manifester level. If you succeed, all the item's psionic properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface  is temporarily closed. A psionic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal power such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.</p><p><i>Area Dispel:</i> When <i>Dispel psionics</i> is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest manifester level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which discharges the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature's psionic items are not affected.</p><p>For each object within the area that is the target of one or more powers, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not affected by an area dispel.</p><p>For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.</p><p>For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the <i>Dispel psionics</i> power, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers targeting the creature or object. You can choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.</p><div topic="Augment" level="8"><p><b>Augment:</b> For every additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).</p><p/>

      <p>You and any creature you touch are drawn along a crystal arc of reverie to the edge of conscious thought and into the region of dreams. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but each one must be touching another one. You physically enter the land of dreams, leaving nothing behind.</p>
      <p>In the region of dreams, you move through a menagerie of thoughts, desires, and phantoms created by the minds of dreamers everywhere. For every minute you move through dream, you can 'wake' to find yourself five miles displaced in the waking world. Thus, a character can use this power to travel rapidly by physically entering where only dreams normally prowl, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back into the waking world. You know where you will come out in the waking world.</p>
      <p><i>Dream travel</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream, but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where you are subject to the vagaries of many dream realities-a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of existence in this fashion requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted travel.</p>
      <p>Any creatures that come along when <i>Dream travel</i> is manifested also make the transition to the borders of unconscious thought. A creature separated from you wanders off into the dreamscape. When the duration ends, all affected creatures return to the waking world as much as 1,000 miles (d%x10) from their starting point. If a creature remains in the dreamscape, it is powerless to leave unless it can manifest the <i>Dream travel</i> power itself or someone who manifests the power seeks out the lost creature.</p>

The vision of those within the shambler is limited to 5 feet, and manifesting powers (or casting spells) within the shambler is difficult due to the constant turbulence felt by those caught in the shambler's form.</p>
      <p>Creatures enveloped by the shambler, regardless of Armor Class, take 1 point of damage for every two manifester levels you have in each round they become or remain within the roiling turbulence of the shambler. Anyone trying to manifest a power must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + power's or spell's level) to successfully manifest a power or cast a spell inside the shambler.</p>
      <p>A wind stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows against the shambler reduces its speed to 0 feet during the first round, and in subsequent rounds moves it in the direction of the wind at a speed of 5 feet. A wind stronger than 20 miles per hour that blows in the direction the shambler travels increases its speed to 15 feet.</p>

    <description>
      <p>As <i>energy adaptation</i>, except that instead of radiating away energy as light, you store up the energy and can later discharge it as a ray. To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays during the power's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your manifester level. As long as this power remains in effect, you can continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays using the stored damage.</p>

To discharge a ray requires a standard action. You can choose to fire any number of rays during the power's duration. The ray you fire must be of one of the energy types you have stored (if you have stored more than one type, you can choose what kind of energy to use for each ray). If a ray successfully strikes its target (requiring a ranged touch attack), the target takes damage equal to the amount of energy damage of that type you have stored, up to a maximum of three times your manifester level.

The first successful attack made against you in each round during the power's duration prompts a response from the field with out any effort on your part. The attack may be physical, the effect of a power, or the effect of a spell (including spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities). An 'ectoburst' discharges from the field, targeting the source of the attack and dealing 4d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. To be affected, a target must be within close range, you must have line of sight and line of effect to it, and you must be able to identify the source of the attack. The ectoburst is a ranged touch attack made using your base attack bonus plus your key ability modifier for your manifesting class.</p>

    <short_description>Become one size category larger.</short_description>
    <description>
      <p>This power causes instant growth, doubling your height, length, and width and multiplying your weight by 8. This increase changes your size category to the next larger one. You gain a +2 size bonus to Strength, a -2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum effective Dexterity score of 1), a -1 size penalty on attack rolls, and a -1 size penalty to Armor Class due to your increased size.</p>
      <p>If your new size is Large or larger, you have a space of at least 10 feet and a natural reach of at least 10 feet. This power doesn't change your speed. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, you attain the maximum possible size and can make a Strength check (using your increased Strength score) to burst any enclosures in the process. If you fail, you are constrained without harm by the materials enclosing you-you cannot crush yourself to death by increasing your size.</p>
      <p>All your equipment, worn or carried, is similarly expanded by this power. Melee and projectile weapons deal more damage.</p>
      <p>Other psionic or magical properties are not affected by this power. Any affected item that leaves your possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them). Multiple effects that increase size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second manifestation of this power to further expand yourself.</p>

      <p>You have a limited ability to falsify one of the subject's senses. The subject thinks she sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels something other than what her senses actually report. You can't create a sensation where none exists, nor make the subject completely oblivious to a sensation, but you can replace the specifics of one sensation with different specifics. For instance, you could make a human look like a dwarf (or one human look like another specific human), a closed door look like it is open, a vat of acid smell like rose water, a parrot look like a bookend, stale rations taste like fresh fruit, a light pat feel like a dagger thrust, a scream sound like the howling wind, and so on.</p>
      <p>You can switch between senses you falsify round by round. You can't alter the size of an object by more than 50% by using this power. Thus, you couldn't make a castle look like a hovel, but you could make it look like a different castle, or a rough hillock of approximately the same size. If this power is used to distract an enemy manifester who is attempting to use his powers, the enemy must make a Concentration check as if being grappling or pinned.</p>

      <p>You can divide yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence 5 feet away. Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and follows your orders, although it will not do anything you wouldn't do yourself. Your duplicate has all your abilities but none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not transfer to your duplicate.</p>
      <p>When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with negative hit points, but it can't reduce your hit points to less than -9.</p>
      <p>If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you die, your duplicate remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative levels. (Once the duration expires, one of the negative levels immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can be removed by standard means.)</p>
      <p>You can have only one <i>fissioned</i> duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power. You cannot use <i>fusion</i> or <i>metaconcert</i> with a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities (the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to use powers such as <i>claws of the vampire</i> or <i>vampiric blade</i> to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. <i>Empathic transfer</i> and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn't a good healing strategy).</p>
      <p>All powers affecting a <i>fissioned</i> creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the <i>fission</i> ends. All damage, including hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn damage, is added together.</p>

    <short_description>You transform into a frightening tentacled beast.</short_description>
    <description>
      <p>You wrench from your subconscious a terrifying visage of deadly hunger and become one with it. You are transformed into a nightmarish version of yourself, complete with an ooze-sleek skin coating, lashing tentacles, and a fright-inducing countenance. You effectively gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks, though you retain your basic shape and can continue to use your equipment. This power cannot be used to impersonate someone; while horrible, your form is recognizably your own.</p>
      <p>You gain the frightful presence extraordinary ability, which takes effect automatically when you charge a foe. Opponents within 30 feet of you that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than you and that witness your charge become shaken for 5d6 rounds if they fail a Will save (DC 16 + your Cha modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
      <p>Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage reduction 5/-, and a +4 bonus to your Strength score. In addition, you gain +10 feet to your land speed as well as a +10 bonus on Climb and Jump checks.</p>
      <p>A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and back. You can make up to four additional attacks with these tentacles in addition to your regular melee attacks in each round that you take a full attack action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you normally threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks in addition to you regular melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with a -5 penalty. If you forgo all your other attacks, making only tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks at your highest base attack bonus with no penalty. These tentacles deal 2d8 points of damage plus one-half your Strength bonus on each successful strike.</p>
      <p>This power functions only while you inhabit your base form (for instance, you can't be metamorphed or polymorphed into another form, though you can use  <i>claws of the beast</i>, and <i>bite of the wolf</i> in conjunction with this power for your regular attacks), and while your mind resides within your own body.</p>

      <p>The fused being has your current hit points plus the other creature's current hit points.

Likewise, all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only once). For each of the six ability scores, the fused being's score is the higher of yours and the other creature's, and the fused being also has the higher Hit Dice or manifester level-this effectively means the fused being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests powers at the higher of the manifester levels that you or the other creature possessed before becoming fused.</p>

In a like manner, the fused being's remaining power points are split between you and the other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered with, as long as you don't exceed the maximum power points for your level and ability score). Ability damage and negative levels are also split between you and the other creature. (If an odd number of negative levels or ability score reductions must be split, you decide whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)</p>

    <description>
      <p>You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane. Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it doesn't really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using <i>astral caravan</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.</p>
      <p>You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest <i>genesis</i>,  reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You can't create lingering psionic effects with this power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you can't create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver or uranium; you're limited to stone and dirt. You can't manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.</p>
      <p>Antigenesis: If <i>genesis</i> is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.</p>

Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius to it, and so on.</p><p>Antigenesis: If <i>genesis</i> is manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.</p><p><i>XP Cost:</i> 1,000 XP.</p><p/>

    <description>
      <p>You attach any melee weapon you can use in one hand-mundane, psionic, or magical-onto the end of one of your arms. The weapon becomes a natural extension of your arm, and that hand blends seamlessly into the shaft, hilt, or head of the weapon. Now that the weapon and you are one, you gain a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls while using the weapon.</p>
      <p>The grafted weapon is considered both a standard weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of effects that distinguish between either weapon type. For instance, the grafted weapon is treated as a natural weapon for the purpose of delivering a touch attack with a power in conjunction with the weapon attack. As with any power (or spell) melee touch attack made in conjunction with a natural weapon attack, the touch attack effect is not delivered unless the natural weapon strikes normally; on a failed attack, the touch power (or spell) is wasted.</p>
      <p>For a psychic warrior under the effect of the <i>claws of the beast</i> power, grafting a weapon means that attacks with this hand deal the base damage of the weapon, instead of the claw upon which a psychic warrior normally relies.</p>
      <p>While your hand is grafted to a weapon, you lose the use of that hand and take a -2 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of hands. Powers that temporarily polymorph or metamorph you can ignore the grafted weapon or alter it normally, at your discretion. If the weapon takes damage, you take damage as well. If you are healed, so is your grafted weapon. If your weapon is destroyed, you permanently lose 2 points of Constitution; the ability drain persists until you can restore your natural anatomy (by means of <i>regenerate</i> or a similar effect).</p>

      <p>You can weaken or strengthen the substance of an object or structure. You can affect both mundane and magical inanimate material. Weakening an object's substance decreases its hardness and hit points, and strengthening it increases its hardness and hit points. You can increase or decrease an object's hardness by up to 5 from its original hardness. When hardness increases, the object (or portion of an object) gains 3 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of increased hardness. When hardness decreases, the object (or portion of an object) loses 2 hit points per inch of thickness for every point of decreased hardness (to a minimum of 1 hit point per inch of thickness).</p>

    <description>
      <p>You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating an entity more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>
      <p>When you manifest this power, a number of power points you designate flows from each participant into a collective pool. One individual is chosen as the <i>metaconcert</i> conductor by mutual consent of the other participants (this is usually the manifester, but doesn't have to be). Until the power ends, this conductor directs the efforts of the group. Misty strands of glowing power link the brows of all the participants in a complex and shifting pattern.</p>
      <p>All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity ccreated with <i>metaconcert</i> (which is under the conductor's command). This entity can't take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all its powers more effectively. Each participant contributing to the entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to save DCs that apply when manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each individual provides a cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes its own saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities.</p>
      <p>If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attack the total is divided among all the members as determined by the conductor.</p>
      <p>If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the participants pay an equal share (the conductor pays the remainder if the cost can't be divided evenly).</p>
      <p>Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area, and as a group can move at a speed of 10 feet. If a participant moves outside the 20-foot-radius area occupied by the others (whether willingly or involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group, and the power point pool of the <i>metaconcert</i> is instantly recalculated.</p>
      <p>All participants who leave before a <i>metaconcert</i> ends or is dismissed reclaim a number of power points equal to the current power point pool divided by the number of members. If the conductor drops out, the power ends. That same number of points is removed from the power point pool.</p>
      <p>When a <i>metaconcert</i> ends normally or is dismissed, remaining power points in the pool are divided among all the participants (the conductor receives the remainder if the points can't be divided evenly).</p>

      <p>You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form, or any other type except construct, elemental, outsider, and undead. The assumed form can have as many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to a maximum of 15.</p>
      <p>You can't assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable) change to match the new form.</p>
      <p>Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you further). If you are slain while under the effect of this power, you revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict, improved grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing, regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike abilities.</p>
      <p>You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary special attacks and special qualities derived from class levels, but you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original form.</p>
      <p>You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial bonus feats, and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal.</p>
      <p>You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that type. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's species. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this power to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.</p>
      <p>When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert to your normal form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal form.</p>
      <p>You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object. You gain the object's hardness and retain your own hit points. You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If you attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, your manifestation of the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the form of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness of 15 or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.</p>
      <p>As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal senses and your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make a Concentration check (DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the duration of this power. If you take damage while in the form of an object, your actual body also takes damage (but the object's hardness, if any, protects you).</p>

      <p><i>Single Target:</i> If <i>microcosm</i> targets a single creature, that creature's senses are pinched off from the real world if it currently has 100 or fewer hit points. The subject's senses are all completely fabricated from within its own mind, though it may not realize this. In reality, the subject sprawls limply, drooling and mewling, and eventually dies of thirst and starvation without care. The subject lives within its own made-up world until the time of its actual death.</p>
      <p><i>Area Effect:</i> If <i>microcosm</i> is manifested on an area, it sends all affected creatures into a shared catatonia (the world is a construct, but within the world, the victims can interact with each other). It affects only creatures that currently have 30 or fewer hit points, and only up to a total of 300 hit points of such creatures. The power affects creatures with the lowest hit point totals first.

    <description>
      <p>The subject is protected from all devices, powers, and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This power protects against powers with the mind-affecting or scrying descriptors. <i>Psionic mind blank</i> even foils <i>bend reality</i>,  <i>limited wish</i>,  <i>miracle</i>,  <i>reality revision</i>,  and <i>wish</i> when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject's mind or to gain information about it (however, <i>metafaculty</i> can pierce the protective quality of <i>psionic mind blank</i>). In the case of <i>remote viewing</i> or scrying that scans an area the creature is in, the effect works but the creature simply isn't detected. <i>remote viewing</i> (scrying) attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.</p>

      <p>You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject's subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind 'germinates' over the period of one week. During this time, the subject begins to unconsciously take on your mannerisms.</p>
      <p>When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the subject's level is eight lower than your own. (In effect, the subject has received eight negative levels-but these are negative levels that can't be removed.) The subject does not have any of your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were eight levels lower. The subject also knows the powers you knew when you were eight levels lower.</p>
      <p>While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with memories of your experiences, it possesses its original 'soul' and physical body and is free to develop its own personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own right that shares your earlier memories.</p>
      <p><i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting <i>mind seed</i>,  or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts. Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination) only by <i>psychic chirurgery</i>,  <i>reality revision</i>, or similarly high-level effects. Manifesting <i>mind seed</i> again during the germination period also cleanses the subject's mind.</p>

      <p>You possess the target's body and force the creature's mind into your body unless it succeeds on a Will save.

      <p>You can call on rudimentary or instinctive knowledge of the subject creature, but not upon its acquired or learned knowledge (such as skills and feats it possesses). The same is true for the subject in your body. The <i>mind switch</i> brings about the following changes.</p>
      <ul>
 <li> You gain the type of your assumed body.</li>
 <li> You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of your assumed body.</li>
 <li> You gain the natural armor, natural attacks, movement, and other simple physical characteristics of your assumed body.</li>
 <li> You gain the extraordinary special attacks and qualities of your assumed body, but you do not gain supernatural or spell-like abilities.</li>
 <li> You gain the possessions and equipment of your assumed body.</li>
 <li> You retain your own hit points, saving throws (possibly modified by new ability scores), class abilities, supernatural and spell-like abilities, spells and powers, and skills and feats (although skill checks use your new ability scores, and you may be temporarily unable to use feats whose requirements you do not meet in your new body).</li>

      <p>Borrowing the subject's power is a separate standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If that attack succeeds, the mental communication provided by this power ends immediately.

You maintain knowledge of the borrowed power until the duration of your <i>thieving mindlink</i> expires, at which time you lose knowledge of the power and the power reappears in the mind of the subject, no matter how far from you the subject is. Even if the subject is slain, you lose knowledge of the borrowed power when this power's duration expires.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You can learn details of an inanimate object's previous owner. Objects accumulate psychic impressions left by their previous owners, which can be read by use of this power. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular object.</p>
      <p><i>1st Minute:</i> Last owner's race.</p>
      <p><i>2nd Minute:</i> Last owner's gender.</p>
      <p><i>3rd Minute:</i> Last owner's age.</p>
      <p><i>4th Minute:</i> Last owner's alignment.</p>
      <p><i>5th Minute:</i> How last owner gained and lost the object.</p>
      <p><i>6th+ Minute:</i> Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.</p>
      <p>The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item, and the original owner (if you keep the power active long enough).</p>
      <p>There is a 90% chance that this power will successfully identify all other former owners in sequence, but there is a 10% chance that one former owner will be skipped and thus not identified.</p>
      <p>This power will not identify casual users as owners. (Anyone who uses an object to attack someone or something is not thereafter considered a casual user.)</p>
      <p>An object without any previous owners reveals no information. You can continue to run through a list of previous owners and learn details about them as long as the power's duration lasts. If you use this power additional times on the same object, the information yielded is the same as if you were using the power on the object for the first time.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You attempt to briefly partition the mind of your foe, calving off a minor personality that is antagonistic to the main personality. The parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main personality. It does not control the body physically, but it can take one standard action each round that is purely mental, such as manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal actions.</p>
      <p>The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject's power point reserve and known powers, but can only manifest powers three or more levels lower than the highest level of power the subject can normally manifest.</p>
      <p>The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that negatively impact the subject, using the highest-level powers possible (so as to deplete the subject's power point reserve), and the most deadly to the subject. You do not have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always works against the interest of the subject.</p>
      <p>Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is targeted by a compulsion or charm effect while under the effect of this power, it can make a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both saving throws fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by the charm or compulsion effect.</p>
      <p>The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main personality is subjected to a <i>haste</i> or <i>schism</i> effect.</p>

The parasitic personality functions with complete autonomy from the main personality. It does not control the body physically, but it can take one standard action each round that is purely mental, such as manifesting a power, in the same turn that the subject takes its normal actions.</p><p>The parasitic personality manifests powers using the subject's power point reserve and known powers, but can only manifest powers three or more levels lower than the highest level of power the subject can normally manifest.</p><p>The parasitic personality actively attempts to manifest powers that negatively impact the subject, using the highest-level powers possible (so as to deplete the subject's power point reserve), and the most deadly to the subject. You do not have control over what the parasitic personality does, though it always works against the interest of the subject.</p><p>Both minds communicate with each other telepathically. If a creature is targeted by a compulsion or charm effect while under the effect of this power, it can make a second saving throw if the first one fails. If both saving throws fail, then this power ends and the creature is affected by the charm or compulsion effect.</p><p>The parasitic personality does not gain any advantages if the main personality is subjected to a <i>haste</i> or <i>schism</i> effect.</p><p/>

    <description>
      <p><i>Precognition</i> allows your mind to glimpse fragments of potential future events-what you see will probably happen if no one takes action to change it. However, your vision is incomplete, and it makes no real sense until the actual events you glimpsed begin to unfold. That's when everything begins to come together, and you can act, if you act swiftly, on the information you previously received when you manifested this power.</p>
      <p>In practice, manifesting this power grants you a 'precognitive edge.' Normally, you can have only a single precognitive edge at one time. You must use your edge within a period of no more than 10 minutes per level, at which time your preknowledge fades and you lose your edge.</p>
      <p>You can use your precognitive edge in a variety of ways. Essentially, the edge translates into a +2 insight bonus that you can apply at any time to either an attack roll, a damage roll, a saving throw, or a skill check. You can elect to apply the bonus to the roll after you determine that your unmodified roll is lower than desired.</p>

    <short_description>Gain the scent ability.</short_description>
    <description>
      <p>You gain an enhanced sense of smell, equivalent to the scent ability of some monsters. This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.</p>
      <p>You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.</p>
      <p>When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.</p>
      <p>If you have the Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. If you are tracking with <i>psionic scent</i>,  you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</p>

This ability allows you to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. With the scent ability, you can identify familiar odors just as humanoids do familiar sights.</p><p>You can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.</p><p>When you detect a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed-only its presence somewhere within range. You can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever you come within 5 feet of the source, you pinpoint the source's location.</p><p>If you have the Track feat, you can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. If you are tracking with <i>psionic scent</i>,  you ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</p><p/>

      <p>You can repair psychic damage or grant another creature knowledge of powers you know, depending on the version of this power you manifest.</p>
      <p><i>Repair Psychic Damage:</i> You can remove any compulsions and charms affecting the subject. In fact, you can remove any instantaneous or permanent effect caused by a psychic power with <i>psychic chirurgery</i>. Unlike with <i>aura alteration</i>, these effects end or are negated as soon as this power is manifested, with no need for another saving throw.</p>
      <p>You can remove all negative levels affecting the subject, regardless of how it lost those levels, restoring it to the highest level it had previously attained. Also, you can restore levels lost to energy drain or a similar effect if the level drain occurred within a number of hours equal to your manifester level.</p>
      <p>You can also remove all psionic effects penalizing the subject's ability scores, heal all ability damage, and remove any ability drain affecting the subject. <i>Psychic chirurgery</i> negates all forms of insanity, confusion, the effect of such powers as <i>microcosm</i>,  and so on, but it does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.</p>
      <p><i>Transfer Knowledge:</i> If desired, you can use this power to directly transfer knowledge of a power you know to another psionic character. You can give a character knowledge of a power of any level that she can manifest, even if the power is not normally on the character's power list. Knowledge of powers gained through <i>psychic chirurgery</i> does not count toward the maximum number of powers a character can know per level.</p>

This substance shimmers like a silver mirror when viewed from some angles but is transparent from other viewpoints. You can smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object.</p>
      <p>Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; in practical terms, they enter a state of stasis. Living flesh with only partial contact with quintessence is also partially pulled out of the time stream (the manifester is immune to this effect). This disruption deals 1 point of damage per round beginning 10 rounds after partial contact occurs.</p>
      <p>Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, there is a 75% chance that the quintessence evaporates back into the continuum. Otherwise, it coalesces again into a 1-inch-diameter bead, available for later use.</p>
      <p>Large quantities of quintessence could theoretically be gathered to preserve large items or structures (or even a complete living creature; if completely immersed, a living creature would not take the damage associated with partial contact). However, psionic characters and creatures are generally loath to do so because accumulations of quintessence weighing 1 pound or more hinder psionic activity within a 5-foot radius of the accumulation: Powers require twice as many power points to manifest, unless the manifester makes a successful Will save (DC 16) each time he or she attempts to manifest a power. Also in these circumstances, manifesting a psi-like ability that is usable at will is a full-round action rather than a standard action.</p>

    <description>
      <p>As <i>bend reality</i>, but with more farreaching effects. A <i>Reality revision</i> can produce any one of the following effects.</p>
      <ul>
 <li> Duplicate any psion power of 8th level or lower, provided the power is not prohibited to you.</li>
 <li> Duplicate any other power (but not a spell) of 6th level or lower, such as a psychic warrior power.</li>
 <li> Duplicate any psion power of 7th level or lower even if it's a power prohibited to you.</li>
 <li> Undo the harmful effects of many other powers, such as <i>microcosm</i>,  <i>geas/quest</i>,  or <i>insanity</i>.</li>
 <li> Create a nonpsionic item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li>
 <li> Create a psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item (see XP cost below).</li>
 <li> Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five <i>reality revisions</i> manifested in immediate succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability score. Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot be negated or dispelled. An inherent bonus cannot exceed +5 for a single ability score. Inherent bonuses to a particular ability score do not stack; only the best one applies.</li>
 <li> Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>Reality revision</i> can aid one creature per manifester level, and all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction.</li>
</ul>
      <p><i>Reality revision</i> can not restore the experience point loss from manifesting a power or casting a spell, or the level or  Constitution loss from being returned to life by those effects that reduce level or Constitution.</p>
      <ul>
 <li> Revive the dead. <i>Reality revision</i> can bring a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection</i> spell. This power can revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but the task takes two manifestations of <i>reality revision</i>, one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life again. <i>Reality revision</i> cannot prevent a character who is brought back to life from losing a level.</li>
 <li> Transport travelers. This power can lift one creature per manifester level from anywhere on any plane and place those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.</li>
 <li> Undo misfortune. <i>Reality revision</i> can undo a single recent event. Manifesting the power forces a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect, and power resistance (if any) applies.</li>
</ul>
      <p>You can try to use <i>Reality revision</i> to produce more powerful effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. The manifestation may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a partial fulfillment.</p>
      <p>Duplicated powers allow saves and power resistance as normal (but save DCs are calculated as though the power is 9th level).</p>
      <p>XP. When a manifestation duplicates a power that has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more. When a manifestation creates or improves a psionic item, you must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item, plus an additional 5,000 XP.</p>

If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the <i>remote viewing</i> attempt fails, and you can't attempt to view that creature again for at least 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.</p>

      <p>If the subject fails its Will save, your mind coalesces a quasi-real viewpoint near enough to the subject to see and hear the subject and its immediate surroundings (up 30 feet in all directions away from the subject).</p>
      <p>While the <i>remote viewing</i> lasts, your real body remains unmoving and unaware of your actual surroundings.

As with any effect that increases speed, this power affects the subject's maximum jumping distance.</p><p>The subject can skate up or down any incline or decline she could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up an incline reduces the subject's speed to normal, while skating down a decline increases her speed by an additional 15 feet. (This adjustment is treated as a circumstance bonus.)</p><p>If you manifest <i>skate</i> on an object, treat the object as having only one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging it along the ground.</p><p/>

      <p>Your psicrystal takes over the responsibility of maintaining concentration on any single power you have manifested and are concentrating on. While maintaining this concentration, the psicrystal is limited to move actions in each round, as normal. When the duration of <i>solicit psicrystal</i> expires, the power you transferred to the psicrystal ends (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal). If necessary, the psicrystal makes Concentration checks using your Concentration modifier.</p>
      <p>You can manifest this power (and transfer the responsibility) with an instant thought, quickly enough to gain the benefit of the power before you take any other actions in a round. Manifesting the power is a swift action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round. You cannot manifest this power when it isn't your turn.</p>

      <p>You can affect one or more objects or creatures by concentrating your mind upon, sending them in a deadly hail at your foes-or simply by hurling your foe! You can hurl one object or creature per manifester level (maximum fifteen separate targets), as long as all are within the power's range and each is no more than 10 feet away from another one. Each object or creature can be hurled a maximum distance of 10 feet per level.</p>
      <p>You must succeed on ranged attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target of the hurled items with the items, applying your Intelligence modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier. Hurled weapons deal their standard damage (your Strength bonus does not apply; arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects deal damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds of weight (for less dangerous objects such as an empty barrel) to 1d6 points per 25 pounds of weight (for hard, dense objects such as a boulder).</p>
      <p>Creatures are allowed Will saves (and power resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by this power.</p>
      <p>If you use this power to hurl a creature against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p>
